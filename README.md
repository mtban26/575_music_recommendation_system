# ASU CSE 575 Final Project: Comparison of Machine Learning Models for a Music Recommendation System
In this project, our group analyzed the performance of prominent clustering algorithms to build a hybrid machine learning model that is designed as a music recommendation system to classify music genres and curate personalized playlists. The dataset is comprised of audio attributes retrieved from the Spotify Web API of Spotify tracks, which can be accessed using this Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset.
