# ASU CSE 575 Final Project: Comparison of Machine Learning Models for a Music Recommendation System
In this project, our group analyzed the performance of prominent clustering algorithms to build a hybrid machine learning model that is designed as a music recommendation system to classify music genres and curate personalized playlists. The dataset is comprised of audio attributes retrieved from the Spotify Web API of Spotify tracks, which can be accessed using this Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset. Exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were conducted to reduce the dataset to a subset of the most influential audio features. Our group then evaluated the performance of the K-Means and BIRCH clustering algorithms in clustering songs by genre with the sihouette score metric, which measures the cluster quality produced by clustering algorithms. Since the K-means clustering algorithm generated a greater silhouette score of 0.59 compared to the silhouette score of 0.57 produced from the BIRCH clustering algorithm, our group decided to integrate the K-Means clustering algorithm with a KNN classification algorithm to construct a hybrid model to recommend new songs based on an input playlist of songs.
